      <h2>Pollock’s Bridge Between the Arts and Sciences</h2>
      <h5>Multimedia Century, 02 December, 2021</h5>

</i></p>
      <p>There is a chasmic divide between the arts and the sciences. This divide exists within academia, but also within popular culture. People generally tend to identify as either left or right-brained; logical or creative. This divide is not a necessary one. The poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said, “science arose from poetry…when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends” (Goethe). The arts and sciences can have an incredible, mutually beneficial relationship. Erik Kandel, in his book Reductionism in Art and Brain Science, describes art and science as two separate cultures in desperate need to meet. A key to bridging this divide is abstract art because of its unique roots in technological advancements, its isolation of neural components of perception, and its focus on deconstructionism. The work of abstract-expressionist Jackson Pollock is a particularly notable piece of this bridge, not just for his breakthroughs in abstract work but for the invocation of science in his pieces... </p>

      <h2>Minimalism: Economics, Politics, Science, & Technology</h2>

      <p>Minimalism is an extreme form of abstract art that originated in New York during the early 1960s. Minimalism was identified through the use of simple geometric shapes built on squares and rectangles and characterized by extreme simplicity of form and a literal, objective approach. The word minimalism gained its popularity amongst young artists interested in resisting the stifling conventions of fine art. It was through the efforts of artists such as Agnes Martin, Donald Judd, and Frank Stella that minimalism became the movement we know today. The idea behind their work was that a work of art should only refer to itself. Minimalists attempted to rid their work of excess association by using hard edge and simple form as opposed to the typical painterly approach. While minimalism sought only to refer to itself, it could not keep itself from being influenced by the factors of its time and creating a large impact in the world beyond itself... </p>

      <p><i>Jackson Pollock's Number 1A, 1948</i></p>
      <p>Both abstract expressionism and pop art originated in the United States in the mid twentieth century. Abstract Expressionism was the United State’s first international art movement, effectively establishing New York as the center of the modern art world, paving the way for Pop Art. One of the most notable abstract expressionists is Jackson Pollock. Jackson Pollock had a tremendous impact on American Expressionism by creating his ‘drip and splash style;’ a new definition of surface and touch, a new syntax of relationships among space, pigment, edge, and drawing, displacing hierarchies with an unprecedented and powerful self-generating structure. Pollock uses the concept of heroic individualism to highlight the narratives of his paintings...

      <h2>Cultures of Experimental Music</h2>

      <p><i>Score of March by Cecil Touchon</i></p>
      <p>During the 1900s, experimental music became increasingly popular. American art and music grew popular, and new genres blossomed in the boom. From artists like Charlie Parker to Julius Eastman, there was no shortage of central figures of American music. Two of the most influential figures in American music were Pauline Oliveros and John Cage. Both of these artists were central figures in their genres and helped with the development of new forms of electronic music. While both artists had strong Eastern and familial influences, their different personal identities helped shaped their vastly different contributions...

      <h2>The Contradictory Nature of the Dada Movement</h2>
      <h5>Multimedia Century, 10 September, 2021</h5>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Marcel_Duchamp%2C_1919%2C_L.H.O.O.Q.jpg" alt="lhooq by marcel duchamp">
      <p><i>LHOOQ by Marcel Duchamp</i></p>
      <p>The Dada art movement was formed during the first world war in Zurich as a reaction to the horrors of way. Dada artists felt the war caused them to question every aspect of society. Their aim was to negate traditional artistic values and create deliberately irrational art and replace old art with the new. A classic example is LHOOQ by Marcel Duchamp which transformed a cheap postcard of the Mona Lisa into an iconic Dada piece. An important concept in Dada is that of creative destruction. In the context of Dada, the term creative destructions refer to the breakdown of previous ideas and concepts regarding art and life. Dada itself means nothing. It is difficult to have a deeper understanding of the idea of creative destruction. Most people can only gain an abstract understanding of the notion. Even iconic Dada artist. Marcel Duchamp did not claim to have a full understanding of dadaism. When interviewed, his answers on the topic of creative destruction were vague and questioning...
